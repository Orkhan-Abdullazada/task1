    <h1>What is HyperText</h1>
    <p>Hypertext is text which is not constrained to be linear.</p>
    <p>Hypertext is text which contains <a href="WWW">links</a> to other texts.The term was coined by <a href="hypertext">Ted Nelson</a> around 1965 (see <a href="RC">History)</a> </p>
    <p>HyperMedia is a term used for hypertext which is not constrained to be text: it can include graphics, video and <a href="">sound</a> for example. Apparently Ted Nelson was the first to use this term too.</p>
    <p>Hypertext and HyperMedia are concepts, not products.</p>
